This breakout PCB will break out the 24 pins from a TTA-24 connector (Found on many Korean phones like LG and Pantech) into 24 test points for easily soldering wires to. 
Great for finding a JTAG pinout in the connector using a JTAGulator. Website link is where to buy TTA-24 compatible connectors on Digikey.
